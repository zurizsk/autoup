{"transcription": " chat focus because today I want to tell a little story about the streamer awards because if you don't know I want a whole last award and we're gonna talk about not just me winning the award but why I'm not happy about winning this award we'll get into that in a little moment but first some context of course everybody knows about the streamer awards 645,000 people tuned in at one point during the event on Saturday it's one of the biggest shows on all of Twitch and Qt crushes it every single year and this year was no exception it was a fucking fantastic year and really the first thing that I had to do for the streamer awards like my job was to get an outfit that was actually the first time where I was like oh fuck the streamer awards are coming up I have to do some work it was getting it was literally getting close and specifically I had to get a fit that I had to match with some crocs so we're gonna watch this clip right here hello I'm joined here with Ludwig why are you doing fuck me eyes are they kept why are you doing we are in the I don't know why I was doing fuck me eyes but I will say the picture that they grabbed from this moment is kind of electric I do look like I'm viewing I don't know why I look like I'm viewing but I do look like I'm viewing hey let me touch it no you can't touch her besides your colored blood don't oh no what happened your shit oh no something dangerous happened oh no maybe use a big wave oh no I guess I can't touch it what am I doing now then but I need to get doing it because your big warship just got crushed by a big dude and I guess all the fuel came out of the the potent it got into the water I guess oh and all the orcas are dying because no one gets this that's what Ludwig has ever and I have to use hair gel and I bought shampoo done lovely then everything good in my life because I have hobbies that enrich my life like killing ah attention all hands on deck popular content creators are making waves in the

Ludwig stone beer it's Ludwig and his individual voiceover we've destroyed an enemy cruise stonebeard crest black and the stone wash ship skin all of this is waiting for you in world of warships franchise join now and let's battle now what I should mention if you look at my fit top to bottom everything above the boot cost me $500 to buy which was a very reasonable price the overcoat the jacket the undershirt the pants all tailored $500 all in it's a great deal man the boots were $1,000 okay it's not something I'm proud of I'm not proud that I spent the thousand dollars on the boots but you know I will say it was part of my job okay what do I mean by that I was sponsored by crocs to wear crocs to the event now what those beautiful people over at crocs don't know is that I do this shit for free thank you very much don't mind the little paycheck I literally did this shit for free when I won streamer of the year two years ago this was my fit I wore red crocs with a kerchow lightning McQueen thing and accepted accepted being the number one streamer that year cool very cool this year I was a crocs ambassador and so I figured you know they're gonna give me a little bread to show up with some crocs I should make sure I show up correct and so my idea is I would get the crocs boots and I'd show up looking like a country guy with a below time what I actually ended up looking like was more accurately spongebob with the squeaky boots anyway the boots were a hit you know they they they definitely caught some attention they also caught a bit of liquor this is Rob CD during the show using my giant croc boot while he's being announced as a nominee for best IRL streamer doing a shooie out of it a classic Australian tradition where you pour alcohol into a shoe then you drink out of the shoe and Rob CD beast mode that's beast shit and the people goes to shout out Jenny so anyway shoes were a hit and you might have noticed if you guys watch the show online or if you follow me on Twitter I was tweeting a lot during the streamer wars and every time someone would go up on stage I would take a picture like like a like a mother would at her son's uh soccer game I would go like this and then I would post the picture online and then I would just make up a caption about how I taught them what they know to get where they are crazy to think I showed quackety what minecraft was 20 years ago when we were hanging out like we used to do very often so proud of him wolf emoji crying face emoji star emoji this is so crazy I taught him how to be gay in reference to austin show winning best streamed series except for cutie who all the credit in the world to her I didn't teach her shit she's the goat and the reason that I'm clarifying here this tweet in this story is that a lot of people after the streamer awards have given me a lot of credit in fact even during the streamer awards because I'm dating cutie people are under the impression I did like at one point I was sitting in the venue drinking champagne and someone goes dude beautiful venue and I was like yeah and they're like great job I was like with what I didn't do anything I know that I am a big part of off brand and fund off brand but guys I didn't do so much of anything I even said to cutie and off brand I do not want to be in any of the negotiations conversations about production for this show I don't want any bias because cutie you know she did a normal thing that you do where she reached out to a bunch of production companies and I was like I don't want me to be a part of the equation it feels weird right this is her thing it's not my thing she should do her thing I shouldn't be a part of it in any way shabour form so even if I'm an owner of off brand I don't want to be a part of it do your thing in fact I had basically two ways I helped and I'm gonna limit myself to that I did two things the first thing and I'll give myself a little bit of credit here whether you liked it or not I'm the one who came up with the idea of inviting Lafayette then which is why I was getting fucking lit when Lafayette came out just cuz I really like the song thank you he was needing performers okay that's one thing I did the other thing that I did for streamer warts is I was a proud supporter I was sat seated at the front row in the very middle and the reason this happens I think maybe cutie might like me but also I will cheer the loudest for every single person who comes up on stage I will laugh at every single joke I will applaud at every single moment and I will give feedback wherever it is fit and you might have heard it throughout the show I'm gonna give you an example of it here in fact I'm bringing up this as an example because Nikki came up to me after the show to thank me because she heard me yelling in the crowd just see if you can hear me yell hello oh god hi hi everyone are you having a good night like in a moment like that when she says that I literally went yes I am so nervous right now I think right there I just yelled don't be and so that's and that's what I did right I sat in the front row I laughed really hard and I and I clapped really hard and I tried to support everybody who's on the stage which led to a lot of reactions that I found out after the show a lot of people screenshot it and tweeted and posted up me because because I was I was going nuts that every single fucking second I was just trying to be there man I was trying to be as present as possible as engaged as possible it even led to this clip which for whatever reason it reminds me of that clip I think from one of those like America's Got Talent shows where it's the kid whose face is like this so anyway that was it that's literally all of my involvement with the streamer awards I had no responsibilities I didn't have to announce any awards I wasn't a red carpet host I didn't expect to win and that's a key part because I did start this story by saying I ended up winning I did not expect this and I don't say that in like a very modest humble way I didn't expect it because I have self-described last year as the worst year of my career right and the events that I wanted to run chess boxing too was canceled and dodgeball was a last second rushed replacement for that event and because I didn't expect to win and because I didn't even want to win I started drinking a bit nothing crazy nothing crazy man I was just I was having a good time is all so a little bit drop right a little bit which isn't a problem if all you're doing is sitting down eating food and clapping at an award show it is a problem when this happens and the winner goes to Ludwig I got a lot of comments on how I reacted to being announced as the winner and I want to clarify it is an absolute honor to win a streamer award it is very sweet that enough people who are probably also in here watching this voted for me to make it possible but again it's not something I wanted to win and we'll get into why and I was also fucking drunk by this point so when I go up on stage I had jack shit all to say I don't even remember what I said this will be my first time watching uh hey what's up how's it going everybody everyone have a good night this is a surprise because last year was my worst year as a creator self described I did fail to run a chess boxing event but still somehow lost 200k in that process so it's still flattering to receive this award I hope I'm still able to make cool shit I'm gonna say it right now I got five years in me left maximum so I hope in that time I do some cool shit thank you all have a good I just noticed peach jars moving like a hitman NPC in that time I do some cool shit thank you all have a good night shout out Judy by the way high social like you right there walk up to cutie I go to kiss her because I love my girlfriend I see that she has makeup on I'm like can't kiss the lips can't kiss the cheek go for the shoulder just like fucking phenomenal play drunk Ludwig couldn't have played it better myself sober anyway that was that now two things we got to talk about first thing I'm seeing in a chat right now five years left we should talk about that when I say five years left what do I mean it means I will leave you all in abandon you for nothing to get cigarettes and never come back does that make you feel better no okay what it means what it means look look look look look technically this week February 16th 2019 I went full time as a content creator so I've been doing it for five years full time half of a decade if I do another five years that will be ten full years to me I don't want to be what I doing what I'm currently doing then it doesn't mean that I won't ever make another video again doesn't mean that I won't ever go live again but what it means to me is that I want to pursue something else in the short time that I get on earth that is slightly different than what was working for the previous you know five current years that I've had and the possible five future years that I might have I don't necessarily mean in ten years I withdraw and become a recluse I'm more so mean that I don't want my job to be pumping out YouTube videos and streams ad nausea that's it back to it so I wasn't initially as you could see my reaction pumped about winning the event but the reason I was concerned about it is because in the past when I have won I've received some shit because I'm dating the person who runs the event and there's you know always some accusations that it's that it's rigged unfair whatever even though it's a very straightforward process and you know it is ultimately your guys fault that still happens so I try to avoid it this year obviously to no success and of course literally within 24 hours of the show ending I got a DM from from I actually a couple of creators and one of them tilted me and I'm not here to fucking start shit or or bring up names but they said something to the effect of your event was actually the worst of the four which I was like what do you want from me it was so out of pocket I don't know why the hell it was necessary to throw that out at me but that just happened I think in part because I happen to date someone who runs a dope ass event that is the most important streamer wardrobe of the year bar none and so that's the message I got and I was fearful of getting in the lead up to this why I did nominate myself why don't vote for myself why don't tell people to vote for me for streamed event and why frankly I got drunk as shit because I was hoping I wouldn't wouldn't I'm not again I'm not look I don't here's the I don't give a fuck because ultimately I won this on what I consider my worst year ever as a creator this year my events are gonna be so fucking godlike that that person in any other creator would not even come close to being able to make what I make so I don't care that's my focus that's my mindset I don't give a shit about certain shit with them I will just do shit they will never be able to do in their life till they die and that to me is much more empowering than fucking getting into a spat with them so I appreciate you guys for helping me win this against my will but I'll make sure if I ever win any trophy any award that there is no question in hell that I deserved it and that was basically my streamer awards in a nutshell really fucking amazing event big shout out security streamer awards after party also sick because I got this moment I'll end on a positive note here just me and Selbyl losing our voices singing good old fashioned my chemical romance and that was it man it was fun University H"}
